# This is a submission script for running `raptor` on the Open Science
# Grid with HTCondor.  It takes care file transfer, resuming, and
# renaming.  It uses the `wrapper` script in the same "bin/" directory
# within the `raptor-osg` git repository.  It can be submitted
# normally with condor_submit:
#
#     condor_submit submit
#
# or run as a command directly `bin/submit`.
