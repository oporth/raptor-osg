# This is a wrapper script for running `raptor` on the Open Science
# Grid with HTCondor.  Note that `ipole` accept more options via a
# paramter file, compare to command line arguments.  Hence, this
# wrapper takes command line arguments, turn them into a `raptor`
# parameter file "model.in" through a template, and then run
# `raptor model.in` to fully configure `raptor`.
# Additionally, we need to select among the pre-compiled variants
# since several important parameters are set at compile time. :-(
